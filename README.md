# Make-game-with-P5.js
This is just me learning P5.js and create game from it.

I didn't execute the file so if you wanna test it. you can test it by running index.html file.
If you want to open the javascript in Learning folder. You need to change directory in index.html Line 16 to another path.
    Example(Mash_button_game/game.js --> To --> Learing/draw.js)

The game is a simple game about just mashing the d button to make the character move to the goal.

For the asset I use, I am downloading it from this guy --> "https://kenney.nl/". Check it out he has many amazing assets.
